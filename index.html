<p class="one">
  The Phantom is a mysterious man who is gifted with musical talents but is also cursed because of his deformity on the right side of his face. He wears a wig to hide his grey, almost little hair yet. He is obsessed with the soprano Christine Daaé, and is called "The Angel of Music" by her, but to others he's named "The Angel of Death, Opera Ghost, or The Phantom of the Opera". 
He's secretive, passionate, and controlling. A musical genius, the Phantom may hide in the walls of the Opera House, but when The Phantom doesn't get what he wants, his rage can be destructive.

<p class="three">
  Christine Daaé, a Swedish, orphaned young Soprano singer who had lost her passion for singing. In fact, Christine only becomes a singer to honor her dead father. Though she initially impresses no one, one person hears the potential in her voice: an unseen "angel of music" who tutors Christine from behind the walls of the opera house where she now lives. When someone incapacitates the lead soprano, Christine takes her place and stuns everyone with her voice. Thus begins both a successful career and a tangled love life, for Christine has caught the attentions of both the Opera Ghost, her supposed "angel," and Raoul, the Viscount of Chagny.

<p class="five">
   Raoul De Chagny, Erik’s rival. A member of one of the noblest families in France, a Vicomte (a French nobleman). Raoul is a surprisingly innocent and passionate young man, willing to prioritize his emotions over his social duties. Christine Daaé's childhood friend, he acts as a foil and contrast to the Phantom. He reveals his nobility of spirit and his devotion to Christine on various occasions. He does not hesitate to put his life at risk for her, thus demonstrating his courage as much as his capacity to put her well-being before his own.
